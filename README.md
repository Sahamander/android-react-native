# Android React Native Project - Discotheque

## Description

This project is a school project aimed at proposing an application that allows users to have a library of music albums and tracks. Users can also add tracks manually. The application is built using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and utilizes the [LastFM](https://www.last.fm/fr/) API to search for music, albums, or artists.
